# Luabinaries

This repository houses the most recent stable versions of the Lua language and creates static binaries ready to download and run.

We aim to create Lua interpreters that are optimized, compact and can run on most Lua supported platforms. 

So far we support:
- Linux x86 64bit (also known as amd64) - filename pattern `luaVV`
- Windows x86 64bit (win64) - filename pattern `luaVV.exe`
## Download

Direct download to our released binaries is possible using the following links:

- lua 5.1 for linux 64 https://github.com/dyne/luabinaries/releases/latest/download/lua51
- lua 5.3 for linux 64 https://github.com/dyne/luabinaries/releases/latest/download/lua53
- lua 5.4 for linux 64 https://github.com/dyne/luabinaries/releases/latest/download/lua54

Lua bytecode compilers are available simply by changing the file name to `luacVV`.

Releases are tagged with the GitHub hash and listed in the [Release page](https://github.com/dyne/luabinaries/releases/).

## Building

The [Makefile](https://github.com/dyne/luabinaries/blob/main/Makefile) does everything needed using the original Lua source-code releases archived in this repository.

They are available on https://lua.org/ftp and listed below:

- lua-5.1.5.tar.gz (Feb 13  2012) `7d5ea1b9cb6aa0b59ca3dde1c6adcb57ef83a1ba8e5432c0ecd06bf439b3ad88`
- lua-5.3.6.tar.gz (Sep 14  2020) `fc5fd69bb8736323f026672b1b7235da613d7177e72558893a0bdcd320466d60`
- lua-5.4.7.tar.gz (Jun 13  2024) `9fbf5e28ef86c69858f6d3d34eccc32e911c1a28b4120ff3e84aaa70cfbf1e30`

To build static binaries ready to run everywhere, we use [Musl](https://www.musl-libc.org/).

To compress the released binaries at ~50% of their original size we use [upx-ucl](https://upx.github.io/).

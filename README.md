# Luabinaries

This repository houses the most recent stable versions of the Lua language and creates static binaries ready to download and run.

We aim to create Lua interpreters that are optimized, compact and can run on most Lua supported platforms. 

So far we support:
- Linux x86 64bit (also known as amd64) - filename pattern `luaVV`
- Windows x86 64bit (win64) - filename pattern `luaVV.exe`
## Download

Direct download to our released binaries is possible using the following links:

- lua 5.1 for linux 64 https://github.com/dyne/luabinaries/releases/latest/download/lua51
- lua 5.3 for linux 64 https://github.com/dyne/luabinaries/releases/latest/download/lua53
- lua 5.4 for linux 64 https://github.com/dyne/luabinaries/releases/latest/download/lua54

Lua bytecode compilers are available simply by changing the file name to `luacVV`.

Releases are tagged with the GitHub hash and listed in the [Release page](https://github.com/dyne/luabinaries/releases/).

## Building

Make sure you installed the dependencies needed for building in your Linux system:

```
sudo apt-get install -y make musl musl-tools gcc-mingw-w64
```

The [Makefile](https://github.com/dyne/luabinaries/blob/main/Makefile) does everything needed using the original Lua source-code releases archived in this repository. Just run `make` to compile the linux binaries and cross-compile the Windows-executables.

The versions of the released binaries are listed below, the respective sources are available at https://lua.org/ftp:

- lua-5.1.5.tar.gz (Feb 13  2012) `7d5ea1b9cb6aa0b59ca3dde1c6adcb57ef83a1ba8e5432c0ecd06bf439b3ad88`

To build static binaries ready to run everywhere, we use [Musl](https://musl.libc.org/).

The released binaries are compressed to ~50% of their original size using [upx-ucl](https://upx.github.io/).
